# SuperHi - Plan, Design, Code your First Website / Aria Oslo Project

This one is a simple 3 page website from a course I was doing at SuperHi. 

Here's the project view https://aria-oslo-1014.superhi.hosting/index.html

The instructir (Rik) divided this course into 4 major lessons;

1. Planning
2. Designing
3. Coding
4. Making responsive

### Plan

In the first part we plan out the website design and make initial wireframes on paper and use Notion to manage our project.

### Design

In the second part we we dive further deep into creating a moodboard for our project and finalizing the initial color scheme, picking typefaces and experimenting different site layouts  on Figma Design tool.

### Code

This part was real fun, for this we used the SuperHi editor as it was made specifically for website development and had a bunch of additional features missing in most IDE's.
Learned a bunch of new stuff here as well, like the semantic HTML, Using Grids in CSS, adding typography with Google, using Flexbox, creating a contact pageand linking it with Formspree.

### Final Touches

In the last part we added media queries and adjusted our design so that it fits better with different viewports.

That's it, if you haven't already you can view the final version of the website here > https://aria-oslo-1014.superhi.hosting/index.html <

From now on, I'll to post each of my project form courses directly on github and share my journey of SuperHi with you.
