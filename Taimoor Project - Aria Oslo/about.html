		    <h1>Aria Oslo is a digital artist based in Portland, Oregon.</h1>
		    <p>
		      She focuses on juxtaposing portraiture with geometric abstraction, a nod to her first career
		      as an architectural technician working on shaping cityscapes. Aria graduated from Oregon State
		      University in 2012 with an art history degree, where she discovered her love for the Orphism
		      art movement - her graduate project was a 3d puzzle and art piece titled Moving On. After
		      deciding to go back to her art roots, Aria launched her 3d puzzle on Kickstarter in 2017 and
		      left her day job. She now produces digital artwork for advertising, commissions and sells
		      prints on her online shop, Orpheum.
		    </p>
		    <p>
		      When Aria is not creating art, she's exploring the Pacific Northwest, reading mystery novels,
		      and hosting board game nights. She can also be found mulling over all kinds of puzzle pieces,
		      contemplating how it all fits together and how art imitates life (or is it the other way
		      around?).
